  1. My experience with coding is all from Interaction 1. Honestly it was hard for me, coding is like learning another language. I tried really hard to take lots of notes in the class and making use of demo's and that's what helped me the most.
  2. I'm very nervous but I'm also very willing to learn. It can be discouraging when I want to create something but have no idea how to go about it, and then also not being able to articulate what I want online to find a tutorial to create it.
  3. I know coding is a very valuable skill and many jobs require it so I really do want to learn and understand it well. My goal is for coding to not be a scary thing.
  4. I used Visual Studio Code last semester and I feel it works the best and is very user friendly.
  5. I used Github a little bit last semester but we didn't really keep up with it that much.
  6. HTML is like the bones, CSS is like the skin/the way you look and Javascript is kind of like your joints/muscles that make you move
